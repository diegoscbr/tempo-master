# Tempo Master

A cycling cadence app that helps you maintain your target RPM through visual beat synchronization.

## Features

- **Visual Metronome** — On-screen beat indicator synced to your target cadence
- **Customizable RPM** — Set any target cadence from 60-120+ RPM
- **Clean Interface** — Minimal, glanceable design optimized for bike mounts
- **Audio Cues** — Optional sound beats to complement the visual rhythm

## How It Works

1. Set your target cadence (e.g., 90 RPM)
2. Mount your phone on your handlebars
3. Match your pedal strokes to the visual beat
4. Build muscle memory for consistent pacing

## Why Cadence Matters

Maintaining a steady cadence improves cycling efficiency, reduces fatigue, and helps prevent knee strain. Most coaches recommend 80-100 RPM for optimal performance.
